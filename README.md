# roboticvoice
Script for processing voice into robotic using voice engines

1) Run the file "Setup.bat"
2) Run the file "Start.py"

In order for the voice to be transmitted everywhere, instead of a microphone, you should install a virtual cable
To add another voice of the robot, you should install another voice engine (it will automatically find the script), then just select it inside the program
